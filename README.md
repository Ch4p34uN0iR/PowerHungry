PowerHungry is just a stupid name for this repository of experimental PowerShell tools I am developing mainly to hone my PowerShell skills and assist me in my every day work.

Current Scripts:
----------------
**Invoke-AdminAccessFinder**:

Searches a list of hosts that a specific user or group identity has administrative access on. Results are based on the CSV output from PowerView's Invoke-EnumerateLocalAdmin.

**Add-LocalAdmin**: 

Adds a user to the local administrator group for the specified computer. (Without using net.exe)

**Delete-LocalUser**: 

Deletes a local user from the specified computer (Without using net.exe)
